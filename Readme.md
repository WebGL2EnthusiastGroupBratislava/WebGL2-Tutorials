# WebGL2 learning group materials
    This repository contains learning materials for webgl2 enthusiasts. Feel free to modify, rewrite, add new materials to it.
# How to get it running
First you should have NPM installed.

After npm is installed, proceed to install typescript (it is a must), and optionally visual studio code.

If you don't have installed typings for webgl2, then you should install it through npm.

A web server is a must. I prefer headless php or python server, for easy use, but you can also use some full blown solution like Apache or nginx et cetera.
