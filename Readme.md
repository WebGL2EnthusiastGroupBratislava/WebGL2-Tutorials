# WebGL2 learning group materials
This repository contains learning materials for webgl2 enthusiasts. Feel free to modify, rewrite, add new materials to it.

# How to get it running
First you should have NPM and a compatible browser installed. Usually the rule of thumb applies, the latest Chrome/Firefox is fully compatible and conformant to webgl2. If you
have doubts, use this chart which browser to install (http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl2).

After npm is installed, proceed to install typescript (it is a must), and optionally visual studio code.
If you don't have installed typings for webgl2, then you should install it through npm.
A web server is a must. I prefer headless php or python server, for easy use, but you can also use some full blown solution like Apache or nginx et cetera.

Optionally you can install SpectorJS (https://spector.babylonjs.com/) for debugging webgl and webgl2 calls. Can be tremendeously helpful when used correctly.
